### A Digital Eye Power Screening System

VisionLens is a web-based and Python-based vision screening system that estimates a user's approximate eye power using image processing and interactive visual tests.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main objective of VisionLens is to provide a simple, low-cost, and accessible method for preliminary eye power screening using digital devices.

The system combines multiple visual testing techniques to improve reliability and accuracy.
